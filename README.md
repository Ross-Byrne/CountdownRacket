## Introduction

As part of my Fourth Year module, Theory of Algorithms, we were asked to solve the countdown numbers game using the Racket functional programming language. One of the main motivations for this project was to gain experience solving a problem that sounds very straight forward but in reality, is not as straight forward as it first appears.

Another learning outcome was learning how to use the functional programming language Racket, which we have never used before.
